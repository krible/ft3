In order to use paid Service, you shall provide you credit or debit card details. <br />Krible is a subscription service. Your credit card will be charged automatically every month according to the amount of monthly subscription fee that is specific for chosen plan. Charges are made in advance for the succeeding month. <br /> <br />If Krible is unable to charge your credit card, an email will be sent to you with instructions to modify credit card details. In this case Service will be suspended until credit card is successfully charged. <br /> <br />You will not be charged for the period your account was suspended. <br /> In case your account is suspended for at least 6 months, it is automatically deleted and Service is terminated. <br /> <br />Unless stated otherwise, all rates and charges shall be stated in US dollars and shall be exclusive of value added taxes (VAT) or any other applicable taxes. <br /> <br />The rates and plans for the Service are published on its Website. We reserve the right to change the rates and plans at any time without notice. If you do not wish to accept such adjustment of rates or/and plans, you are entitled to terminate the Account with effect from the date on which the adjustment of rates or/and plans becomes effective. You agree that by continuing to use the Service, following the adjustments of the rates, you accept such adjustments. <br /><br />Krible will provide a response to email and telephone enquiries within a maximum of 48 hours. <br /> <br />In the event you believe that Krible has charged you in error, you must contact Krible customer services via our online web form or via e-mail welcome@krible.com within 60 days of such a charge.

Your continued use of the Service shall constitute your acceptance to be bound by the terms and conditions of the revised Agreement. The most recent version of this Agreement can be found on the Website. <br /><br /> <span style="font-size: 30px;">SERVICE AVAILABILITY; MODIFICATIONS </span><br /> <br />You hereby waive all claims for damages of the Service unavailability, scheduled or unscheduled, and indemnify Zingaya from any similar claims made by any other users on your Account. <br /> We may at any time change, modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Service at any time, including, without limitation, the availability of any Service feature, database or content, hours of availability, or equipment needed to access the Service. We may also impose limits on certain features or restrict your access to parts or all of the Service without notice or liability. <br /> We do not guaranty that the Service can be accessed from all locations or with all equipment or types of communications access. We do not recommend, and do not support, use of the Service in mission critical situations or on mission critical equipment. <br /> Zingaya will try to provide the Service with minimum disruptions. However please understand that Zingaya can not guarantee that the Service will always function without disruptions, delay or other imperfections. Since the Service may be transmitted through public Internet lines and the public switched telephone network ("PSTN"), there may be power outages or Internet service disruption and you may experience some disruptions e.g. packet loss and delay which will affect the quality of your communication. <br /> Zingaya may change technical features in order to keep pace with the latest demands and technological developments or to comply with any regulations. Zingaya may also have to repair, improve, and/or upgrade the Service and this may require us to restrict, limit, suspend, interfere and/or interrupt the Service. <br /> We recommend that you provide us with a prior notice (to the following email address: support@zingaya.com) of any planned marketing activities or other calling events which may use significant Service capacity so that we can undertake reasonable steps to make the Service available for your event. <br /> We reserve the right to limit or suspend Service usage under any Account using the Service at volumes significantly in excess of planned usage or prior usage patterns, or when reasonable prior notice of capacity needs has not been provided. <br /><br /> <span style="font-size: 30px;">USE OF ZINGAYA CONTENT AND SOFTWARE </span><br /> <br />All information and materials published, transmitted, or otherwise available on the Website or through the Service (including, but not limited to, terms of service, use policies, service documentation, user help, informational resources, images, equipment configurations, interactive voice response, menus, audio clips, and video clips, collectively, "Content") are protected by copyright or trademarked (as applicable), and owned or controlled by Zingaya, its licensors, or affiliated companies. You shall abide by all copyright and trademark notices, limitations, and restrictions applicable to any Content or to the Service.

THE SERVICE IS PERFORMED AND THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EACH OF WHICH IS HEREBY DISCLAIMED). <br /> YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR BACKUP OF ANY DATA WHICH YOU MAY REQUIRE TO BE STORED WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE. <br /> IN PARTICULAR, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED UNDER THE SERVICE GUARANTEE, ZINGAYA DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICE IS BORNE BY YOU. <br /> THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE SERVICE WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE WITHOUT IT. <br /> SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSIONS OF AN IMPLIED WARRANTY, SO PORTIONS OF THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY BY JURISDICTION. <br /> Further, Zingaya disclaims any responsibility for the accuracy, content, or availability of information available through the Service, and Zingaya shall not be held responsible for the accuracy, legality, or decency of material contained in third-party sites or through third-party services (including any service or content reached through the Service or the Website), and you hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect thereto. <br /><br /> <span style="font-size: 30px;">NO LIABILITY </span><br /> <br />TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL ZINGAYA BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY DAMAGES THAT RESULT IN ANY WAY FROM ANY USE OF THE ACCOUNT OR THE SERVICE BY ANY PARTY OR YOUR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE (EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE GUARANTEE) OR YOUR RELIANCE ON OR USE OF INFORMATION OR SERVICES PROVIDED ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE OR THE WEBSITE OR THAT RESULT FROM MISTAKES, OMISSIONS, INTERRUPTIONS, ERRORS, DEFECTS, DELAYS IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, OR ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARE DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF ZINGAYA MIGHT HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. <br /> IF, NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, ZINGAYA IS FOUND LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES FROM ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE), ZINGAYA'S LIABILITY TO YOU WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE SERVICE IN THE LAST THREE (3) MOST RECENTLY PAID MONTHS. <br /> SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION AND EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. <br /> Zingaya does not control, or have any knowledge of the content of any communication(s) spread by the use of the Service. The content of the communication is the entire responsibility of the person whom such content has been originated from.

YOU WAIVE ANY CLAIMS AGAINST ZINGAYA BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF ANY FAILURE TO PROVIDE SHORT DIGIT EMERGENCY DIALING CAPABILITY AND INDEMNIFY ZINGAYA AGAINST ANY SIMILAR CLAIM BY ANY USER OF YOUR ACCOUNT. <br /> We strongly recommend that alternative methods, specifically intended for mission critical or emergency services usage, be used, rather than the Service, to deliver emergency messages of any urgent, public safety or similar nature. <br /> You agree that Zingaya has no liability to you arising out of or related to any such use and indemnify Zingaya for any claim or liability, and all resulting costs, damages, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses) arising out of your use of the Service for such purposes. <br /> <br /><span style="font-size: 30px;">INDEMNIFICATION </span><br /> <br />You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Zingaya, and its subsidiaries, parents, affiliates, managers, shareholders, officers, directors, agents, resellers, sales affiliates, licensees or other partners, and employees, from all claims, demands, liabilities, losses, damages and expenses (including without limitation reasonable legal fees and expenses), arising from or in connection with your use of the Service, any other user's use of your Account, or your or their conduct while using the Service, your violation of this Agreement, or your violation of any rights of another, including without limitation any violation of applicable law or any tort committed while using the Service. <br /> <br /><span style="font-size: 30px;">JURISDICTION </span><br /> <br />This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.
